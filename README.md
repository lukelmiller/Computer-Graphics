# Computer Graphics
This is a repo for all of my Computer Graphics projects. UARK Computer Graphics Spring 2021 CSCE 4813. This repository is for a backup of all my assignments I had in computer graphics (a UARK class taught by John Gauch). We used openGL to create different graphical images, learned about many topics in the Graphics community, and did a lot of demos with the game Tetris.
